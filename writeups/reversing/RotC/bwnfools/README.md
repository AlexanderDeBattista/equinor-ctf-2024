## RotC :baby:

Downloading the challange we got a file named `rot_C`.
Decided to run it in a sandbox to see its output:

```shell
â””â”€$ ./rot_C
Original string: LWA{z0_tBjo_y0aha3_pu_ao4a_z7y1un}
Enter rotation amount: 1
ðŸ‘Ž That does not look like the start of a flag to me. ðŸ‘Ž
Rotated string: MXB{a0_uCk
                                                  
```

Since the `LWA{}` string shared the same pattern as the flag, and the userinput requested a number for rotations, I assumed it was some kind of ROT (Caesar cipher[1]).

Opened CyberChef, and just clicked a few times getting the number 19, and then the flag was revealed int in the output:

```shell
EPT{s0_mUch_r0tat3_in_th4t_s7r1ng}
```

Just for fun, tried the lucky number 19 in the sandbox, getting a `Not allowed` message.
But we already had the flag.

```shell
â””â”€$ ./rot_C
Original string: LWA{z0_tBjo_y0aha3_pu_ao4a_z7y1un}
Enter rotation amount: 19
Not allowed!
```
