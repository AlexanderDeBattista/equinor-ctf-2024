### Task

First we break down what we know and sort out whats importaint:

1. Man
1. Born in 1890
1. Emigrated from Fjære 1922 towards New York on ship named "Stvr.fj."
1. Was a sailor
1. Probably rich

We want the third name of his wife

### Solution

A search in [Digital Archives](https://www.digitalarkivet.no/search/3/100095?fornavn=&etternavn=&kjonn=&bosted=Fjære&fodestad=&fodselsdato=&fodselsaar=1890&alder=&stilling_stand=&familiestilling=&aar=&utreisedato=&reisemal=&ankomstdato=&linje=&skip=Stvr.fj.&agent=&pass=&nytt_yrke=&aarsak=&utreisehavn=&ekspdato=&kontraktdato=&herred=&fogderi=&prgjeld=) with all filters applied returns 3 people:

Since it also mentions that the man is a "sailor," we choose the man who is listed as a "Matros", Anders Bergqvist.

A Google search for "Anders Bergqvist 1980" gives some results from [MyHeritage](https://www.myheritage.no/names/anders_bergquist). There, we find out who Anders was married to:

Now, we are left with two names that we can try, her current name Bergqvist and her maiden name Johnsen.
